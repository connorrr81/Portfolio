# Portfolio
A collection of machine learning projects I have completed for my MSc Data Science and side projects, comprising:

- **Deep Learning in keras**: Dissertation on exploring data augmentation techniques for a deep learning approach to the classification of insects given their genetic sequence.
- **Binary classification with scikit-learn**: Predicting sales in a marketing campaign, to upload.
- **Unsupervised learning with scikit-learn**: Dimensionality reduction assignment on anthroprometric measurements.
- **EDA with matplotlib and seaborn**: Exploratory data analysis and visualisations on tidal data and the erasmus data set.
- **Visualisatoins with ggplot**: Obtaine interesting insights from the erasmus dataset.
